Before to get into it. if you want to keep learning about this
you cand check the Stephen Grider Tutorials on Udemy.

Interested in learning [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

The difference between the original with this is I'm going to use yarn
(You could work with npm normally as well)

First install the dependencies
```
yarn install
```

Then to run the project
```
yarn start
```

Also to work with axios I'm using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
